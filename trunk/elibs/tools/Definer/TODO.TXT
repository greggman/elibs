	O = todo
	* = done
	? = maybe do
	X = canceled
-----------------
O Make all rule args get used when printing body, or do not collect
	all rule args.
	Example:
		const "#define %1 %2" "/* this is a constant*/"
	Currently the "/* this is a constant*/" string will not be printed
	when the 'const' rule is executed.
